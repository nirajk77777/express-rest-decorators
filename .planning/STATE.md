# State

<!-- Project memory. Updated at every phase/plan transition. -->

## Project Reference

**Name:** Express Controllers (working title)
**Core Value:** Bring the routing-controllers DX into the Express v5 + modern-TypeScript era — same mental model, dropped Koa baggage, native async errors, legacy TypeScript decorators + reflect-metadata, pluggable validators.
**Mode:** yolo
**Granularity:** coarse
**Parallelization:** enabled

## Accumulated Context

### Roadmap Evolution

- Phase 1 edited: regenerated: switched to legacy experimentalDecorators + reflect-metadata; single-package repo (no monorepo); DI remains pluggable
- Phase 1 edited: CLAUDE.md, PROJECT.md, research/STACK.md updated to match new direction: legacy experimentalDecorators + reflect-metadata in core; single-package repo (no monorepo); DI remains pluggable. Historical research preserved with override banners.

### Key Decisions Locked-In (from research)

- **Decorators:** Legacy TypeScript decorators only (`experimentalDecorators: true` + `emitDecoratorMetadata: true`); runtime guard throws if either flag is missing or `reflect-metadata` is not imported.
- **Metadata:** Hybrid — module-private WeakMaps for library-owned state (keyed by class constructor and prototype); `reflect-metadata` ONLY for TS-emitted keys (`design:paramtypes`, `design:returntype`, `design:type`). No module-level mutable global registry. No `Reflect.defineMetadata` use by core.
- **Validation:** Standard Schema (type-only) is the core surface; Zod/Valibot/ArkType work natively without adapter code.
- **DI:** Optional `useContainer(IocAdapter)` with WeakMap default; no built-in container.
- **Routing:** One `express.Router()` per controller; path-to-regexp v8 syntax validated at registration.
- **Errors:** Express v5 native async propagation; ONE library-installed Express error middleware; no per-handler try/catch.
- **Build:** `tshy` for dual ESM+CJS; `attw` + `publint` mandatory in CI.
- **Repo:** Single-package repo (one `package.json`, one `src/`, one `dist/`); optional adapter integrations as sub-path exports.
- **Lint/format:** Biome 2 (ESLint 9 + `@typescript-eslint` 8 fallback documented).
- **Tests:** Vitest 3, run under both `pool: 'forks'` and `pool: 'threads'`.
- **Node:** `engines.node: ">=20"`, recommend 22 LTS, CI matrix on 20/22/24.
- **`reflect-metadata`:** core runtime dependency, used exclusively for reading TS-emitted type metadata; consumer must `import 'reflect-metadata'` at app entry.
- **API shape:** method-level input declaration `@Get('/:id', { params, query, body })` with destructured handler args (chosen for cleaner type inference).

### Open Questions

- **Package name** — deferred until before publish (Phase 5).
- **Class-validator legacy adapter** — Out of Scope for v1; technical blocker no longer applies under legacy decorators, but scope decision unchanged. Revisit at v1.x.

### Key Decisions Made (from 01-01)

- BUILD-04/05/06 aligned to legacy decorator direction; reflect-metadata is a core dep; single-package repo confirmed.

### Key Decisions Made (from 01-02)

- Single-package repo bootstrapped with legacy decorator flags (experimentalDecorators: true, emitDecoratorMetadata: true).
- reflect-metadata in dependencies (not devDependencies) — required at runtime by consumers.
- Module-private WeakMaps in storage.ts — controllerMap and methodMap never exported directly (D-07).
- Type-only StandardSchemaV1 re-export produces zero runtime cost — no schema lib imported by core.
- Action interface uses unknown-typed request/response — zero Express imports in type definitions (ROADMAP SC #5).
- vitest@3.x used (not 4.x) per CLAUDE.md constraint; setupFiles includes reflect-metadata for test environment.

### Key Decisions Made (from 01-03)

- unplugin-swc added to vitest config — esbuild (vitest default) strips emitDecoratorMetadata; SWC emits it correctly for tests.
- makeRouteDecorator helper DRYs the eight route decorators while preserving individual named exports.
- Probe-class strategy for runtime guard — deterministically detects missing emitDecoratorMetadata regardless of user class shape (zero-arg controllers no longer bypass check, ROADMAP SC #2 satisfied).
- Test B9 guard-integration test simplified — vi.mock ESM hoisting with dynamic import caused SWC parse errors; guard integration verified structurally and via G1-G4 tests.

### Key Decisions Made (from 01-05)

- IocAdapter.get<T>(cls, action?) returns T | Promise<T> — allows async container adapters without breaking sync consumers.
- DefaultContainer uses WeakMap<ClassConstructor<unknown>, unknown> for per-class singleton caching — avoids Map key collision by using the constructor reference directly.
- resetContainer() restores to the module-level defaultContainer constant (not a fresh DefaultContainer()) — preserves singleton identity across test teardowns.
- Zero DI library imports in core — grep gate confirms no tsyringe/typedi/awilix/inversify imports in src/; ROADMAP SC #4 satisfied.

### Key Decisions Made (from 01-04)

- toJSON() field policy: never include stack or cause — only { name, message, status } (+ details/source for BadRequestError when set); safe for HTTP responses.
- Object.setPrototypeOf(this, new.target.prototype) in every constructor — required for instanceof correctness across CJS/ESM dual-package scenarios.
- BadRequestError carries details: ValidationIssue[] and source: string as optional fields — contract pre-committed for Phase 2 to populate at validation time without a breaking change.
- ES2022 cause passed through to Error constructor via super(message, options) — native support, no wrapping.

### TODOs

(none yet — populated as phases progress)

### Blockers

(none)

## Session Continuity

**Last action:** 01-05-PLAN.md complete — IocAdapter interface + DefaultContainer (WeakMap caching) + useContainer/getContainer/resetContainer hooks implemented. TDD: 9/9 tests pass, tsc --noEmit clean. Zero DI library imports in core (ROADMAP SC #4 satisfied).

**Resume command:** Continue Phase 01 with next plan (01-06)

**Last updated:** 2026-05-08
